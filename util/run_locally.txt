/////// Running the node server locally ///////

* Install node.js on your machine.


* Open a command line in the same directory where your local Avoidance repo is located.


* Run 'npm install' and the appropriate node modules will be installed.


* After the modules are installed you run 'node index.js' to start the server.
  - You should be able to navigate to 'http://localhost:5000/' while the server
    is running.
  - To stop the server press ctrl-c at the command line.



/////// Running the database locally ///////

* Install PostgreSQL on your machine from https://www.postgresql.org/.
  - You will be asked to choose a password during installation.  Remember this as it will be needed later.


* Open a command line in the 'bin' directory within the directory where you chose to install Postgres.


* Run 'psql' and choose the user 'postgres' and use the password you chose during installation.


* You should be inside the postgres command line environment.  Run 'CREATE DATABASE Avoidance;' without quotes but with the semicolon.


* Run '\connect Avoidance' to connect to the database.


* Run the following command (you should just be able to copy and paste it.)

CREATE TABLE scores(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    character_type INT NOT NULL,
    total_score INT NOT NULL DEFAULT -10000,
    health_score INT NOT NULL DEFAULT -10000,
    social_score INT NOT NULL DEFAULT -10000,
    created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


* Run '\q' to exit the psql environment.


* In order for the node server to connect to the database, environment variables must be set on your system.
  Setting environment variables is different on different operating systems so look up a guide on how to do this.
  On Windows there is a 'pg_env.bat' in the installation directory for Postgres.  You can copy this to another
  directory, modify it as needed, and run it before you start the node server (you must run the node server from the same command terminal that you set the environment variables in.)
  The following variables need to be set (the password and port might be different depending on your choices during installation):

PGHOST=localhost
PGDATABASE=Avoidance
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=your_password_here
PGPORT=5432
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/Avoidance


* Once you have the database set up and the server is running you should be able to navigate to
  http://localhost:5000/scores/topscores
  If the database is running correctly this would usually show a JSON list of the top ten
  scores (it will be blank at this point as no scores have been recorded.)
